# Volume IV Topology and Metric Source Crosswalk

This document parks the first source-modeled definitions and theorems for the
Volume IV topology and metric-space reference modules while the metric-space
and topological-space chapters are refactored from Ó Searcóid and Willard.

The reference definitions are included for reader orientation. The theorem
statements are modeled against Mathlib's `TopologicalSpace` and `MetricSpace`
APIs, not against the reference structures.

## Topology

### Topology

- Lean file: `LRA/VolumeIV/TopologicalSpaces/TopologicalSpace.lean`
- Source: Willard, *General Topology*, Definition 3.1
- Book-modeled statement: A topology on a set `X` is a collection of subsets of
  `X`, called open sets, containing `X` and `∅`, closed under arbitrary unions,
  and closed under finite intersections.
- Lean declaration:

```lean
structure TopologyDefinition (X : Type u) where
  IsOpen : Set X → Prop
  isOpen_univ : IsOpen Set.univ
  isOpen_empty : IsOpen ∅
  isOpen_sUnion :
    ∀ S : Set (Set X), (∀ U, U ∈ S → IsOpen U) → IsOpen (⋃₀ S)
  isOpen_inter :
    ∀ U V : Set X, IsOpen U → IsOpen V → IsOpen (U ∩ V)
```

### Topological Space

- Lean file: `LRA/VolumeIV/TopologicalSpaces/TopologicalSpace.lean`
- Source: Willard, *General Topology*, Definition 3.1
- Book-modeled statement: A topological space is a pair `(X, τ)` consisting of a
  carrier set `X` and a topology `τ` on `X`.
- Lean declaration:

```lean
structure TopologicalSpaceDefinition where
  Carrier : Type u
  topology : TopologyDefinition Carrier
```

### Closed Set

- Lean file: `LRA/VolumeIV/TopologicalSpaces/TopologicalSpace.lean`
- Source: Willard, *General Topology*, Definition 3.3
- Book-modeled statement: A subset `E` of a topological space `X` is closed in
  `X` exactly when its complement in `X` is open.
- Lean declaration:

```lean
def ClosedSetDefinition {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (E : Set X) : Prop :=
  IsOpen (Eᶜ)
```

### Closed-Set Family of a Topology

- Lean file: `LRA/VolumeIV/TopologicalSpaces/TopologicalSpace.lean`

  the family of subsets whose complements are open.

def ClosedSetFamilyOfTopology (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Set (Set X) :=
  {F | ClosedSetDefinition F}
```

### Closed Set Axioms

- Lean file: `LRA/VolumeIV/TopologicalSpaces/TopologicalSpace.lean`
- Source: Willard, *General Topology*, Theorem 3.4

  and `∅`, are closed under arbitrary intersections, and are closed under finite
  unions.

```lean
theorem closed_sets_in_topological_space
    {X : Type u}
    [TopologicalSpace X] :
    IsClosed (Set.univ : Set X) ∧

      (∀ C D : Set X, IsClosed C → IsClosed D → IsClosed (C ∪ D)) := by
  sorry
```

### Topology From Closed Set Axioms

- Lean file: `LRA/VolumeIV/TopologicalSpaces/TopologicalSpace.lean`
- Source: Willard, *General Topology*, Theorem 3.4
- Book-modeled statement: Conversely, any family of subsets satisfying the
  closed-set axioms determines a topology whose closed sets are exactly that
  family.
- Lean declaration:

```lean

    {X : Type u}
    (ClosedSet : Set X → Prop)
    (closed_univ : ClosedSet Set.univ)

      ∀ S : Set (Set X), (∀ C, C ∈ S → ClosedSet C) → ClosedSet (⋂₀ S))
    (closed_union :
      ∀ C D : Set X, ClosedSet C → ClosedSet D → ClosedSet (C ∪ D)) :
    ∃ topology : TopologicalSpace X,
      ∀ C : Set X, @IsClosed X topology C ↔ ClosedSet C := by

  function `δ_z` sends `x` to the nonnegative real distance from `z` to `x`.

  is pointlike when it satisfies the two point-function inequalities.

  metric space into the set of point functions, is bijective.
